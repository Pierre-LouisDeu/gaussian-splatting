Images to .ply 3D model with structure from motion (COLMAP) and gaussian splating : 

0 - Upload your dataset in Google Drive and mount in Colab. (If you want to train your own dataset)
1 - Check if the selected GPU has CUDA.
2 - Clone Gaussian Splatting repository.
3 - Fetch sample data. Optional if you have your own dataset and mounted it via Drive. 
4 - Install dependencies for COLMAP
5 - Build COLMAP. Takes ~30 minutes.
6 - Convert the dataset using COLMAP.
7 - Train the converted dataset.
